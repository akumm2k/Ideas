- Your life is already at risk. You will die. Only make optimal
  choices. Do not lower your standards ever.

- Use screens as portaits and flags in your house, and let all these
  ideas and visions flow thru them, keeping you in touch with your
  past selves. You are not just you right now. You are a community
  across time, and the as the present you, I am working to help you
  achieve what the past passions. I am working to make your life
  easy and those of the people you have cared for and will care for
  -- this is a deal between us that you will never break. You will
  take 10 bullets for them and still keep going. Take care ;)

- Give.

- Promote usage of ChatGPT in homework. However, lower the weight
  given to homework. Run chatgpt on the homework and ask it the
  following question for each submission: "Based on this specific
  submission what questions should I ask the student to verify that
  they are the ones who wrote the code?". And then, ask the students
  during the homework review those questions. Every one who made a
  submission have to defend it somehow. If they don't they lose the
  homework points.
    Expound this idea to your supervisor. :)
