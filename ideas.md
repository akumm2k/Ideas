## Do not settle for the sub-optimal

- Your life is already at risk. You will die. Only make optimal
  choices. Do not lower your standards ever.

## Surround yourself with your core values

- Use screens as portaits and flags in your house, and let all these
  ideas and visions flow thru them, keeping you in touch with your
  past selves. You are not just you right now. You are a community
  across time, and the as the present you, I am working to help you
  achieve what the past passions. I am working to make your life
  easy and those of the people you have cared for and will care for
  -- this is a deal between us that you will never break. You will
  take 10 bullets for them and still keep going. Take care ;)

## Keep Giving

- Give.

## Dealing with LLM as a tool in academia

- Promote usage of ChatGPT in homework. However, lower the weight
  given to homework. Run chatgpt on the homework and ask it the
  following question for each submission: "Based on this specific
  submission what questions should I ask the student to verify that
  they are the ones who wrote the code?". And then, ask the students
  during the homework review those questions. Every one who made a
  submission has to defend it somehow. If they don't they lose the
  homework points.
    Expound this idea to your supervisor. :)

## Don't do it unless it's voluntary

- You have to suffer voluntarily. You have to do everything you want
  to do with full consent, absolutely volutarily, in order to do
  anything approximating something perfect.
- Physiologically, doing things voluntarily is equivalent to having
  full neurological drive.

## Reiterate. Look at the forest.

- This is what people miss. People start to do extremely domain
  specific things (working in a node), such that they lose track
  of the bigger picture (the tree or the forest).
  Take time every week to look at the forest.

## Defense mechanism: Consumed by self (cautiously)

- Be consumed by yourself, without risking overconsumption and
  derailling. This is so it will be harder for people to join-in
  unless they are really up for putting up with you.

  How to prevent overconsumption and going off track?
  - Well, there's certain anchors / axioms that
    keep you from derailing.
    Eg: the bible, your writings, your closed ones who keep you
    accountable, and your idols.
      - How do we ensure that these anchors are robust?
        - Pick tough anchors. How about truth? gratitude? honor?
          hard-work? love? care? passion? sacrifice? discipline?
          faith?
          Would it be enough for you to live
          by them and would you be okay to die for them?
          Yes.
          Is there a better alternative? I can't think of any.
  - Let these anchors keep you from falling in the face of rejection.
    To live, you must risk rejection.

## Getting out of a rut

- Decide and do loop for things you want to do. Just keep inching
  forward. **Offense**
- No loop for things you do not want to do. Just keep saying no.
  **Defense**

## Betrayal

- Life is unfair by nature. That's why the least we can do is be fair to others.
- Therefore, being unfair -- "betrayal" -- is the worst form of sin.

---

## Victimhood

- Never use your problems as an excuse for not doing important things.
- Typically, those important things are the antidote to the problems
  themselves.

## Strength

Strength is not just about pure power output. It is about technique.
If you positon the egg just right, it can sustain hundreds of pounds.

The opportuunity offers itself through school, through hard times.

that lay ahead. Practise grit, practise patience, practise truth, ...

- Take the shot to die for your passion.

Punish actions, not people.
