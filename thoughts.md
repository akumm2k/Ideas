- Your life is already at risk. You will die. Only make optimal
  choices. Do not lower your standards ever.

- Use screens as portaits and flags in your house, and let all these
  ideas and visions flow thru them, keeping you in touch with your
  past selves. You are not just you right now. You are a community
  across time, and as the present you, I am working to help you
  achieve the passion of your past. I am working to make your life
  easy and those of the people you have cared for and will care for
  -- this is a deal between us that you will never break. You will
  take 10 bullets for them and still keep going. Take care ;)

- Give.

- You have to suffer voluntarily. You have to do everything you want
  to do with full consent, absolutely volutarily, in order to do
  anything approximating something perfect.

- While there are certainly psychopaths out there,
  most men aren’t as creepy as they are naive.
  Labeling someone as "creepy" doesn’t help them
  improve--it just brands them.
  Worse, it may push them into internalizing that label,
  eventually becoming what they’ve been accused of.
