# Message to women on ghosting

Women often feel the sting of a breakup more intensely.
If women get ghosted by a man they care about,
it's likely to hit them harder.
This follows from the general temperament of women
tending towards neuroticism.
I suspect that by failing to offer clear closure, women encourage
men that host vengeance to reciprocate in kind (or not so much).

Now, I am not vengeful, but I do not forget. I remember,
and I know how to defend myself.
Decency and strength are powerful against ignorance and
weakness to face and express the truth. Remember, your vices
are not just yours. You influence others in ways you can't fathom.
