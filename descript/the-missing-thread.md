# The Missing Thread

This file weaves a tapestry of profound connection, capturing the
essence of a lifelong journey. Within these pages, we unveil a
framework that, while not exhaustive, holds the key to cultivating a
remarkable bondâ€”a union that thrives on harmony and complementarity.
It is a testament to the power of two intertwined souls, where I find
myself as one half, united in the pursuit of a relationship destined
for greatness.

# Things I look for in finding the thread:

- faith and hard work towards some personal ideal or passion.
  - this also helps with the isolation, necessary in a relationship.
- negotiation: without negotiation, someone is a tyrant and other the slave. I have no tolerance for that.
  - Negotiation, though potenially painful in the short-term, solves deep and most important problems at their root.
- play:
  - Life is going to be tough. Our ancestors will die, our children will suffer. Do we know how to have keep things light hearted, put in effort to please each other?
  - Why not use it as reinforcement for solving tough problems--which will be in our way 100%?
- unfiltered honesty:
  - I don't care how bad the truth is. I just care it's not a lie.
- willingness to improve together:
  - Perfection is not achievable, but its diligently constant pursuit--excellence--is.
  - open to doing new things that will bind each other together.

Extra Notes:

- life is a risk, and we need meaning to offset that.
